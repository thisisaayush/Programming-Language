1. Analysis of Algorithms
    - Analysis of algorithms is the process of evaluating and understanding the efficiency and performance
      of algorithms. It involves studying how the execution time and resource usage (typically memory) of
      an algorithm grow with the size of the input data.

    - The primary goals of algorithm analysis are to:
        a. Compare Algorithms: Compare different algorithms for solving the same problem and determine which one
        is more efficient in terms of time and space.

        b. Predict Performance: Estimate how long an algorithm will take to run or how much memory it will use for
        different input sizes.

        c. Identify Bottlenecks: Identify the parts of an algorithm that consume the most resources, helping developers
        optimize those areas.

    - There are two main aspects to algorithm analysis:
        a. Time Complexity Analysis: Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm grows with the size
           of the input. It is typically expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth
           rate of the algorithm's running time. The most common notations used are O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n),
           O(n^2), O(2^n), etc. Time complexity analysis helps answer questions like, "How does the running time increase
           as the input size doubles?"

        b. Space Complexity Analysis: Space complexity measures how the memory usage of an algorithm grows with the input
           size. It is also expressed using Big 0 notation, and it helps answer questions like, "How much memory is
           required for this algorithm as the input size increases?" Space complexity analysis is essential to ensure that
           algorithms don't consume excessive memory, especially when dealing with large datasets.

    - The analysis of algorithms involves several techniques:
        a. Worst-case analysis: This considers the algorithm's performance under the most adverse conditions. It provides
           an upper bound on the running time and memory usage.

        b. Average-case analysis: This considers the algorithm's performance on an average input. It is often more
           challenging than worst-case analysis and may require knowledge of probability and statistics.

        c. Best-case analysis: This looks at the algorithm's performance under the most favorable conditions. It provides
           a lower bound on the performance, although it's rarely used in practice.
